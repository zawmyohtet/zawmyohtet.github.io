I certainly did! So, when Apple announced their &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels&quot;&gt;Foundation Model Framework&lt;/a&gt; at this year&apos;s WWDC, my ears perked up immediately. I was captivated – how exactly would this work, and just how capable could it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very next morning, I eagerly downloaded the Xcode beta, dove into their documentation, and set out to build some on-device LLM magic. My excitement hit a snag, though. Turns out, it couldn&apos;t run on the emulator, and upgrading my iPhone and Mac to the latest developer beta wasn&apos;t an option for me at the moment. Sigh – a minor setback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, my attention soon shifted to Android when I discovered their ML Kit GenAI API. I decided to try out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/genai/rewriting/android&quot;&gt;Rewriting API&lt;/a&gt;, only to face another hurdle: my Pixel 6a wasn&apos;t supported. Still, I was determined to see how convenient it would be to integrate ML Kit into an app. After a couple of hours (and a little help from Gemini for the UI!), I successfully integrated Android ML Kit into my app. While I finally got a taste of the developer experience, I was still itching for the actual user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My story didn&apos;t end there! I had the incredible opportunity to attend Google I/O Extended Singapore 2025. One of the speakers gave a fantastic talk about on-device language models, and that&apos;s where I learned about the Google Gen AI Edge Gallery project. As soon as I got home, I compiled the app, and finally, I could experience on-device GenAI firsthand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my interest certainly didn&apos;t stop there. I decided to dig even deeper. Why not build something myself and truly get my hands dirty with the developer experience? This meant hours spent searching for the perfect model, grappling with the Android LLM Inference API, meticulously figuring out the UI, and dusting off my old Android development knowledge. So far, the UI is heavily inspired by the Google Gen AI Edge Gallery project and create the rewrite feature on my own way. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/litert-community/Gemma3-1B-IT/tree/main&quot;&gt;litert-community/Gemma3-1B-IT&lt;/a&gt; model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./screenshot_20250624_001128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Device&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Sum Up My On-Device LLM Journey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Android and iOS platforms good developer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Apple&apos;s Foundation Model Framework and Android&apos;s ML Kit APIs are quite user-friendly, though I believe the documentation could definitely be improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it works as expected on a wider range of devices, Apple&apos;s support for structured outputs and tool calling from their Foundation Model Framework will be a real game-changer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Android LLM Inference API, in its current state, seems quite raw. Apps still need to load their own models, which might not be practical for widespread use and could ultimately lead back to relying on hosted LLM services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gemma3 1B model can run on my Google Pixel 6a device pretty well. I haven&apos;t tried complicated task but the current result meet my expectation. (Hay! better don&apos;t expect too high on such small model, right?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of my exploration! I still have so much more to dig into, and I&apos;m excited to share my new findings with you all soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first blog posted on blogspot platform last 15 years ago. All my blog posts were about iOS back then. Then I moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;. The reason behind was to learn how to use cpanel and cloud hosting. It was quite a challenging experience for a person living in a third world country which only had very slow internet. Anyhow, I created my own first wordpress theme, used one click installer from cpanel and setup domain without knowing how it works internally. But I believe it showed me what my passion is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting my first permanent job, I could no longer maintain my personal blog. The domain and hosting were expired and I stopped blogging. During that time, social media started to become popular and I believe people&apos;s attention moved to short and concise content rather than reading long blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few years, static site generators became popular and github offers personal pages. I decided to setup one for myself. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt; first. Then moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Although I spent time setting up (a couple of themes, contents, environment, etc), I was not able to write regularly. My blog was dead internally although it is alive and online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I am back. Let&apos;s see how far I can go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://astro.build/&quot;&gt;Astro&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure&quot;&gt;Astro pure theme&lt;/a&gt; and hosts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><h:img src="/_astro/hello-world-thumbnail.B3TyIY1-.png"/><enclosure url="/_astro/hello-world-thumbnail.B3TyIY1-.png"/></item></channel></rss>

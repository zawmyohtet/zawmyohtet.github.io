In my daily work and personal interest projects, I use a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. With this diverse nature, I need to set up my work environment to be flexible.

I have been using containerised development environments for quite some time. While some people(like me) prefer a single, common containerized environment, others like to have a separate one for each project. Both approaches have pros and cons, which is a topic for another post.

While I am preparing containerised developments for agentic application developments for myself, I thought it would be a great idea to share this with others. [So here you go](https://github.com/zawmyohtet/agent-playground).  

This include three containerised environments, 
- jupyter notebook
- python environment for agent development
- python + nodejs environment for MCP server development

Environments are designed to fulfil all necessary requirements to start building and testing your agentic application. It also contains a few example and complete setup guides. 

I am also working with this environment daily and I'm always adjusting it based on my daily experiences.

Please don’t hesitate to give feedback, suggestions, and pull requests if you are willing to contribute.

Hope you enjoy it!

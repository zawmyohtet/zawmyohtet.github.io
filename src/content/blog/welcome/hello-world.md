It has been quite a long I haven't done any blogging.

My first blog posted on blogspot platform last 15 years ago. All my blog posts were about iOS back then. Then I moved to [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/). The reason behind was to learn how to use cpanel and cloud hosting. It was quite a challenging experience for a person living in a third world country which only had very slow internet. Anyhow, I created my own first wordpress theme, used one click installer from cpanel and setup domain without knowing how it works internally. But I believe it showed me what my passion is.

After getting my first permanent job, I could no longer maintain my personal blog. The domain and hosting were expired and I stopped blogging. During that time, social media started to become popular and I believe people's attention moved to short and concise content rather than reading long blog posts.

After a few years, static site generators became popular and github offers personal pages. I decided to setup one for myself. I used [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) first. Then moved to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Although I spent time setting up (a couple of themes, contents, environment, etc), I was not able to write regularly. My blog was dead internally although it is alive and online.

Now, I am back. Let's see how far I can go!

This blog uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [Astro pure theme](https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure) and hosts on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
